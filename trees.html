      <p>The leaves of the sugar maple tree are borne on a smooth stalk. 
    They are palmate and measure three to five inches in width and height. 
    They have five lobes with serrated margins. The division between the lobes is smooth,
     shallow and rounded. The leaves turn into colors of yellow, orange and deep red during fall.
    </p>
    <p>
    The two lobes at the base of the leaves are smaller than the other three and are almost parallel to each other. 
    The leaves are dark green above and light green below.
    A sugar maple tree can produce all-male flowers or all female flowers or both on the same tree. Some trees bear flowers that have both the male and female sex organs. The flowers of the sugar maple are found in clusters and are greenish-yellow. 
    They appear in spring just before the leaves emerge.
